 Kolab_Storage Development TODO List
=====================================

 - Handle TLS/SSL accross all drivers (see also the Storage factory in Core).

 - Readd history updates

 - Use IMAP Condstore

 - Use IMAP CATENATE

 - Handle attachments / VFS

 - Do not hide the prefix of the shared namespace?

 - Fix the triggering decorator

 - allow cli config file overriden by cli params

 - Multi-Host support

 - Decide on private share annotation data.

 - Support remapping the "anonymous" user

 - Support creating "system" folders in the shared namespace

 - The cache decorators are no decorators but alternative implementations.

 - Support multiple-formats when writing the objects.

 - Support a descriptive text of the groupware object in the primary MIME part.

 - Verify if deleting a complete folder can fully adhere to the Kolab
   spec without too much hassle (alternative: The consumer of the API
   has to use the methods in correct order)

 - Support servers without annotation support

 - Do not overwrite the previous XML part (should only be modified)

 - Split the "Driver" part into a separate package.
